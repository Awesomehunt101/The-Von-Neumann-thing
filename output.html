    <h1>What is an Output?</h1>
    <p>An output device is a device that converts computer information into information that a human can
        read/listen/understand. One example is of a computer monitor. The computer reads the monitor as a monitor then
        converts the information provided by the input devices to the monitor. So if you press the key "A" on a
        keyboard, that "A" will be displayed on the monitor.</p>
