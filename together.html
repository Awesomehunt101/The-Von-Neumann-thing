    <h2>Lets use an example that I like: The Chrome Dino Game. You start with the input which is the keyboard. You press
        a key, and that information get transfered through busses to the CPU, where that information gets processed,
        while its processing that information, the CPU stores the math its doing in the RAM, once the CPU is done, that
        gets transported to the output, which is the display, and you see how bad you are at the game, then write a
        program to do it for you.</h2>
