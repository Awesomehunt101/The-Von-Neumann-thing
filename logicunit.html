        <h1>What is an arithmetic logic unit?</h1>
        <p>A arithmetic logic unit is basicaly the foundation for all computers, and computer parts including the CPU,
            GPU and much, much more. Its job is to take the basic information from the computer, and transform it into
            binary numbers, and then deal with those numbers. So if we didnt have this part, there would be no CPU,
            which means no computer. </p>
