    <h1>What is the Control Unit?</h1>
    <p>The control unit is a part of the CPU that tells other componits like the RAM, input devices, and output devices
        how to resond to instructions sent by the rest of the processor. I cant give an example, becuase unlike other
        devices, there only is one control unit in the processor, so it is it's own example.</p>
