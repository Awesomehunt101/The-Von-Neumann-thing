    <h1>What is an Input?</h1>
    <p>An input device is something that tells the computer what to do, like a keyboard. These inputs devices tell the computer what to
        do, for example, If you press the key "A" on a keyboard, you are telling the computer to write "A" on the
        screen. You can use input devices to login, type an essay, select things with the mouse etc.</p>
